## Overview
This is one of the first challenge where I tested the Javascript plus Animate.css all in one place including Nav Bar which was implemented via using W3 Schools.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
First I build the design from top to bottom as per given in the files then added the css plus javascript at the end to see how it works.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned
I learned the basics of implemtting javascript and making a layout without using bootstrap and making it responsive.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
// For 1st IoS Button 
var iosBtn = document.querySelector(".ios-btn");

iosBtn.addEventListener("click", animateBtn);

function animateBtn (){
    iosBtn.classList.toggle("animation");
}
```

### Continued development
The responsiveness can be improved plus more js can be added and make this site unique.
