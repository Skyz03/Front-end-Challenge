## My process
Followed from top to bottom of the CSS page applying the techniques learned to replicate the design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

There is a lot I leanred like the ``ul`` tags for the ```footer``` area about flex box reverse row to make it as per the design, and more about the use of grid areas and the use of proper sematic HTML elements.

### Continued development

The background can be focused in the future by making them opposite where the top one is only blue and rest is automatically white ... plus the icons in the footer section can be improved.

### Useful resources

-MDN web docs for Flexbox & Grid.
